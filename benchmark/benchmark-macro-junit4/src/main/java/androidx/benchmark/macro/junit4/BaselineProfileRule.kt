/**
 * A [TestRule] that collects Baseline Profiles to be embedded in your APK.
 *
 * These rules are used at install time to partially pre-compile your application code.
 *
 * `BaselineProfileRule` is only supported on Android 13 (API 33) and above, or if using a rooted
 * device, Android P (API 28) and above.
 *
 * ```
 * @RunWith(AndroidJUnit4::class)
 * class BaselineProfileGenerator {
 *     @get:Rule
 *     val baselineProfileRule = BaselineProfileRule()
 *
 *     @Test
 *     fun startup() = baselineProfileRule.collect(
 *         packageName = "com.example.my.application.id"
 *     ) {
 *         pressHome()
 *         // This block defines the app's critical user journey. Here we are
 *         // interested in optimizing for app startup, but you can also navigate
 *         // and scroll through your most important UI.
 *         startActivityAndWait()
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note that you can filter captured rules, for example, if you're generating rules for a library,
 * and don't want to record profiles from outside that library:
 *
 * ```
 *     @Test
 *     fun generateLibraryRules() = baselineProfileRule.collect(
 *         // Target app is an integration test app which uses the library, but any
 *         // app code isn't relevant to store in library's Baseline Profile
 *         packageName = "com.example.testapp.id"
 *         filterPredicate = {
 *             // Only capture rules in the library's package, excluding test app code
 *             // Rules are prefixed by tag characters, followed by JVM method signature,
 *             // e.g. `HSPLcom/mylibrary/LibraryClass;-><init>()V`, where `L`
 *             // signifies the start of the package/class, and '/' is divider instead of '.'
 *             val libPackage = "com.mylibrary"
 *             it.contains("^.*L${libPackage.replace(".", "/")}".toRegex())
 *         },
 *     ) {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * ```
 *
 * See the [Baseline Profile Guide](https://d.android.com/baseline-profiles) for more information
 * on creating Baseline Profiles.

     * @param maxIterations Maximum number of iterations to run when collecting profiles.
     * @param stableIterations Minimum number of iterations to observe as stable before assuming
     *   stability, and completing profile generation.
     * @param outputFilePrefix An optional file name prefix used when creating the output
     *    file with the contents of the human readable baseline profile.
     *    For example: `outputFilePrefix-baseline-prof.txt`
     * @param includeInStartupProfile determines whether the generated profile should be also used
     *   as a startup profile. A startup profile is utilized during the build process in order to
     *   determine which classes are needed in the primary dex to optimize the startup time. This
     *   flag should be used only for startup flows, such as main application startup pre and post
     *   login or other entry points of the app. Note that methods collected in a startup profiles
     *   are also utilized for baseline profiles.
     * @param strictStability Enforce if the generated profile was stable
     * @param filterPredicate Function used to filter individual rules / lines of the baseline
     *  profile. By default, no filters are applied. Note that this works only when the target
     *  application's code is not obfuscated.
     * @param [profileBlock] defines the critical user journey.
