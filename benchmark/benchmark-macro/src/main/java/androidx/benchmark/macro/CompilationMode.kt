/**
 * Type of compilation to use for a Macrobenchmark.
 *
 * Every Macrobenchmark has compilation reset before running, so that previous runs do not interfere
 * with the next. This compilation mode dictates any pre-compilation that occurs before repeatedly
 * running the setup / measure blocks of the benchmark.
 *
 * On Android N+ (API 24+), there are different levels of compilation supported:
 *
 * * [Partial] - the default configuration of [Partial] will partially pre-compile your application,
 * if a Baseline Profile is included in your app. This represents the most realistic fresh-install
 * experience on an end-user's device. You can additionally or instead use
 * [Partial.warmupIterations] to use Profile Guided Optimization, using the benchmark content to
 * guide pre-compilation to mimic an application's performance after some, and JIT-ing has occurred.
 *
 * * [Full] - the app is fully pre-compiled. This is generally not representative of real user
 * experience, as apps are not fully pre-compiled on user devices, but this can be used to either
 * illustrate ideal performance, or to reduce noise/inconsistency from just-in-time compilation
 * while the benchmark runs.
 *
 * * [None] - the app isn't pre-compiled at all, bypassing the default compilation that should
 * generally be done at install time, e.g. by the Play Store. This will illustrate worst case
 * performance, and will show you performance of your app if you do not enable baseline profiles,
 * useful for judging the performance impact of the baseline profiles included in your application.
 *
 * * [Ignore] - the state of compilation will be ignored. The intended use-case is for a developer
 * to customize the compilation state for an app; and then tell Macrobenchmark to leave it unchanged.
 *
 * On Android M (API 23), only [Full] is supported, as all apps are always fully compiled.
 *
 * To understand more how these modes work, you can see comments for each class, and also see the
 * [Android Runtime compilation modes](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/configure#compilation_options)
 * (which are passed by benchmark into
 * [`cmd compile`](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/jit-compiler#force-compilation-of-a-specific-package)
 * to compile the target app).
