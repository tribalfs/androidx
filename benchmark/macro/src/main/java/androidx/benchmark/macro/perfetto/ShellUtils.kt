/**
 * Convenience wrapper around [UiDevice.executeShellCommand()] which enables redirects, piping, and
 * all other shell script functionality.
 *
 * Unlike [UiDevice.executeShellCommand()], this method supports arbitrary multi-line shell
 * expressions, as it creates and executes a shell script in `/data/local/tmp/`.
 *
 * Note that shell scripting capabilities differ based on device version. To see which utilities
 * are available on which platform versions,see
 * [Android's shell and utilities](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/shell_and_utilities/README.md#)
 *
 * @param script Script content to run
 * @param stdin String to pass in as stdin to first command in script
