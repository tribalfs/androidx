/**
 * Instrumentation runner for benchmarks, used to increase stability of measurements and minimize
 * interference.
 *
 * To use this runner, put the following in your module level `build.gradle`:
 *
 * ```
 * android {
 *     defaultConfig {
 *         testInstrumentationRunner "androidx.benchmark.AndroidBenchmarkRunner"
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Minimizing Interference
 *
 * This runner launches a simple opaque activity used to reduce benchmark interference from other
 * windows. Launching other activities is supported e.g. via ActivityTestRule and ActivityScenario -
 * the opaque activity will be relaunched if not actively running before each test, and after each
 * test's cleanup is complete.
 *
 * For example, sources of potential interference:
 * - live wallpaper rendering
 * - homescreen widget updates
 * - hotword detection
 * - status bar repaints
 * - running in background (some cores may be foreground-app only)
 *
 * ## Clock Stability
 *
 * While it is better for performance stability to lock clocks with the `./gradlew lockClocks` task
 * provided by the gradle plugin, this is not possible on most devices. The runner provides a
 * fallback mode for preventing thermal throttling.
 *
 * On devices that support [android.view.Window.setSustainedPerformanceMode], the runner will set
 * this mode on the window of every Activity launched (including the opaque Activity mentioned
 * above). The runner will also launch a continuously spinning Thread. Together, these ensure that
 * the app runs in the multithreaded stable performance mode, which locks the maximum clock
 * frequency to prevent thermal throttling. This ensures stable clock levels across all benchmarks,
 * even if a continuous suite of benchmarks runs for many minutes on end.
