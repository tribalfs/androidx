/**
 * A handler to a publisher/subscriber pair.
 *
 * <p>Upstream units publish the frames to the edge, which will be delivered to the downstream
 * subscribers. Edge usually contains both the image buffer and the specifications about the
 * image, such as the size and format of the image buffer.
 *
 * <p>One example is Androidâ€™s {@link Surface} API. Surface is a handler to a {@code BufferQueue}.
 * The publisher, e.g. camera, sends images to the {@link Surface} by using APIs such as
 * {@link ImageWriter}, OpenGL and/or NDK. Subscribers can get the frames by using APIs such as
 * {@code ImageReader.OnImageAvailableListener} or {@code SurfaceTexture.OnFrameAvailableListener}.
