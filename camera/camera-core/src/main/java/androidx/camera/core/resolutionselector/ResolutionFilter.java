     * <p>OEMs might make the width or height of the supported output sizes be mod 16 aligned for
     * performance reasons. This means that the device might support 1920x1088 instead of
     * 1920x1080, even though a 16:9 aspect ratio size is 1920x1080. Therefore, the input
     * supported sizes list also contains these aspect ratio sizes when applications specify
     * an {@link AspectRatioStrategy} with {@link AspectRatio#RATIO_16_9} and then also specify a
     * ResolutionFilter to apply their own selection logic.
     *
     * @param supportedSizes  the supported output sizes which have been filtered and sorted
     *                        according to the other resolution selector settings.
     * @param rotationDegrees the rotation degrees to rotate the image to the desired
     *                        orientation, matching the {@link UseCase}â€™s target rotation setting
     *                        . For example, the target rotation set via
     *                        {@link ImageCapture.Builder#setTargetRotation(int)} or
     *                        {@link ImageCapture#setTargetRotation(int)}.
     * @return the desired ordered sizes list for resolution selection. The returned list should
     * only include sizes in the provided input supported sizes list.
