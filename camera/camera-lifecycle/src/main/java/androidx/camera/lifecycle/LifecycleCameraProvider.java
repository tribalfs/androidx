     * before restarting it.
     *
     * <p>Multiple use cases can be bound via adding them all to a single bindToLifecycle call, or
     * by using multiple bindToLifecycle calls.  Using a single call that includes all the use
     * cases helps to set up a camera session correctly for all uses cases, such as by allowing
     * determination of resolutions depending on all the use cases bound being bound.
     * If the use cases are bound separately, it will find the supported resolution with the
     * priority depending on the binding sequence. If the use cases are bound with a single call,
     * it will find the supported resolution with the priority in sequence of {@link ImageCapture},
     * {@link Preview} and then {@link ImageAnalysis}. The resolutions that can be supported depends
     * on the camera device hardware level that there are some default guaranteed resolutions
     * listed in {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice#createCaptureSession(List,
     * CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback, Handler)}.
     *
     * <p>Currently up to 3 use cases may be bound to a {@link Lifecycle} at any time. Exceeding
     * capability of target camera device will throw an IllegalArgumentException.
     *
     * <p>A UseCase should only be bound to a single lifecycle at a time.  Attempting to bind a
     * UseCase to a Lifecycle when it is already bound to another Lifecycle is an error, and the
     * UseCase binding will not change.
     *
     * <p>Only {@link UseCase} bound to latest active {@link Lifecycle} can keep alive.
     * {@link UseCase} bound to other {@link Lifecycle} will be stopped.
