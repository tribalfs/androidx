/**
 * Compose passes data through the composition tree explicitly through means of parameters to
 * composable functions. This is often times the simplest and best way to have data flow through
 * the tree.
 *
 * Sometimes this model can be cumbersome or break down for data that is needed by lots of
 * components, or when components need to pass data between one another but keep that implementation
 * detail private. For these cases, [Ambient]s can be used as an implicit way to have data flow
 * through a composition.
 *
 * [Ambient]s by their nature are hierarchical. They make sense when the value of the ambient needs
 * to be scoped to a particular sub-hierarchy of the composition.
 *
 * ```
 *     // One must create an Ambient instance, which can be referenced by the consumers
 *     // statically. Ambient instances themselves hold no data, and can be thought of as a
 *     // type-safe identifier for the data being passed down a tree. The Ambient constructor takes a
 *     // single parameter, a factory to create a default value in cases where an ambient is
 *     // used without a Provider. If this is a situation you would rather not handle, you
 *     // can throw an error in this factory
 *     val ActiveUser = Ambient.of<User> { error("No active user found!") }
 *
 *     // Somewhere up the tree, a "Provider" component can be used, which has a required
 *     // "value" parameter. This would often be at the "root" of a tree, but could be
 *     // anywhere, and can also be used in multiple places to override the provided value
 *     // for a sub-tree.
 *     @Composable fun App(user: User) {
 *         ActiveUser.Provider(value=user) {
 *              SomeScreen()
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     // intermediate components do not need to know about the ambient value, and can have
 *     // zero dependencies on it
 *     @Composable fun SomeScreen() {
 *         UserPhoto()
 *     }
 *
 *     // A component that wishes to consume the ambient value can use the corresponding
 *     // "ambient" effect, which returns the current value of the ambient, and subscribes the component
 *     // to changes of it
 *     @Composable fun UserPhoto() {
 *         val user = +ambient(ActiveUser)
 *         ImageView(src=user.profilePhotoUrl)
 *     }
 * ```
