 * A [CompositionReference] is an opaque type that is used to logically "link" two compositions
 * together. The [CompositionReference] instance represents a reference to the "parent" composition
 * in a specific position of that composition's tree, and the instance can then be given to a new
 * "child" composition. This reference ensures that invalidations and ambients flow logically
 * through the two compositions as if they were not separate.
