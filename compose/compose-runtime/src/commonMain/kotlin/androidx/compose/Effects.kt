 * An effect to introduce a state value of type [T] into a composition.
 *
 * This is useful when you have a value that you would like to locally mutate and use in the context of a composition. Since
 * the returned [State] instance implements [Model], changes to the [State.value] property will be automatically tracked in
 * composition and schedule a recompose.
 *
 * The [State] class can be used several different ways. For example, the most basic way is to store the returned state
 * value into a local immutable variable, and then set the [State.value] property on it.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *    @Composable
 *    fun Example() {
 *        val count = +state { 0 }
 *
 *        TextView(text="You clicked ${count.value} times")
 *        Button(
 *            text="Click me",
 *            onClick={ count.value += 1 }
 *        )
 *    }
 *
 * Additionally, you can destructure the [State] object into a value and a "setter" function.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *    @Composable
 *    fun Example() {
 *        val (count, setCount) = +state { 0 }
 *
 *        TextView(text="You clicked ${count} times")
 *        Button(
 *            text="Click me",
 *            onClick={ setCount(count + 1) }
 *        )
 *    }
 *
 * Finally, the [State] instance can be used as a variable delegate to a local mutable variable.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *    @Composable
 *    fun Example() {
 *        var count by +state { 0 }
 *
 *        TextView(text="You clicked $count times")
 *        Button(
