package androidx.compose

/**
 * [Model] can be applied to a class which represents your application's data model, and will cause
 * instances of the class to become observable, such that a read of a property of an instance of
 * this class during the invocation of a composable function will cause that component to be
 * "subscribed" to mutations of that instance. Composable functions which directly or indirectly
 * read properties of the model class, the composables will be recomposed whenever any properties
 * of the the model are written to.
 *
 * [Model] also adds an MVCC transaction system to ensure data consistency across threads.
 *
 * Consider the following example:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.samples.modelSample
 *
 * In this example, `LoginScreen` is recomposed every time the username and password of the
 * model updates, keeping the UI synchronized with the model. There is no need to call
 * [androidx.compose.Recompose] manually.
