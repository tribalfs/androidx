/**
 * This component creates a scope which will be the root of recomposition for any reads or writes to
 * [Model] classes that happen inside of it. This can be used to improve performance in situations
 * where you know that a specific [Model] object will need to change at high frequencies, and you
 * want to reduce the burden of recomposition.  It is recommended that you not introduce [Observe]
 * into the composition until it is clear that is necessary to improve performance.
