/**
 * [Recompose] is a component which passes a "recompose" function to its children which, when
 * invoked, will cause its children to recompose. This is useful if you are updating local state
 * and need to cause a recomposition manually.
 *
 * In most cases we recommend using [Model] classes or [state] with immutable types in order to
 * maintain local state inside of composables. For cases where this is impractical, Recompose can
 * help you.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.samples.recomposeSample
 *
 * Note: The above example can be done without [Recompose] by annotating `LoginState` with [Model].
 *
 * @see Model
 * @see Observe
 * @see invalidate
