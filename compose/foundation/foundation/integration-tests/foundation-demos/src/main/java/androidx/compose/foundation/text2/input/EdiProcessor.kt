     * This method updates the internal editing buffer with the given TextFieldValue.
     * This method may tell the IME about the selection offset changes or extracted text changes.
     *
     * Retro(halilibo); this function seems straightforward but it actually does something very
     * specific for the previous state hoisting design of TextField. In each recomposition, this
     * function was supposed to be called from BasicTextField with the new value. However, this new
     * value wouldn't be new to the internal buffer since the changes coming from IME were already
     * applied in the previous composition and sent through onValueChange to the hoisted state.
     *
     * Therefore, this function has to care for two scenarios. 1) Developer doesn't interfere with
     * the value and the editing buffer doesn't have to change because previous composition value
     * is sent back. 2) Developer interferes and the new value is different than the current buffer
     * state. The difference could be text, selection, or composition.
     *
     * In short, `reset` function used to compare newly arrived value in this composition with the
     * internal buffer for any differences. This won't be necessary anymore since the internal state
     * is going to be the only source of truth for the new BasicTextField. However, `reset` would
     * gain a new responsibility in the cases where developer filters the input or adds a template.
     * This would again introduce a need for sync between internal buffer and the state value.
