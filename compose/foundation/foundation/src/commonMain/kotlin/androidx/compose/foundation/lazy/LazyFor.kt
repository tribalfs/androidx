/**
 * A vertically scrolling list that only composes and lays out the currently visible items.
 *
 * See [LazyColumnForIndexed] if you need to have both item and index params in [itemContent].
 * See [LazyRowFor] if you are looking for a horizontally scrolling version.
 *
 * @param items the backing list of data to display
 * @param modifier the modifier to apply to this layout
 * @param state the state object to be used to control or observe the list's state
 * @param contentPadding a padding around the whole content. This will add padding for the.
 * content after it has been clipped, which is not possible via [modifier] param. You can use it
 * to add a padding before the first item or after the last one. If you want to add a spacing
 * between each item use [verticalArrangement].
 * @param reverseLayout reverse the direction of scrolling and layout, when `true` items will be
 * composed from the bottom to the top and [LazyListState.firstVisibleItemIndex] == 0 will mean
 * we scrolled to the bottom.
 * @param verticalArrangement The vertical arrangement of the layout's children. This allows
 * to add a spacing between items and specify the arrangement of the items when we have not enough
 * of them to fill the whole minimum size.
 * @param horizontalAlignment the horizontal alignment applied to the items
 * @param itemContent emits the UI for an item from [items] list. May emit any number of components,
 * which will be stacked vertically. Note that [LazyColumnFor] can start scrolling incorrectly
 * if you emit nothing and then lazily recompose with the real content, so even if you load the
 * content asynchronously please reserve some space for the item, for example using [Spacer].
 * Use [LazyColumnForIndexed] if you need to have both index and item params.
