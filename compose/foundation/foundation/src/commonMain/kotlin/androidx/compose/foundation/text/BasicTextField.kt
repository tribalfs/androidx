/**
 * Basic composable that enables users to edit text via hardware or software keyboard, but
 * provides no decorations like hint or placeholder.
 *
 * Whenever the user edits the text, [onValueChange] is called with the most up to date state
 * represented by [String] with which developer is expected to update their state.
 *
 * Unlike [TextFieldValue] overload, this composable does not let the developer to control
 * selection, cursor and text composition information. Please check [TextFieldValue] and
 * corresponding [BasicTextField] overload for more information.
 *
 * It is crucial that the value provided in the [onValueChange] is fed back into [BasicTextField] in
 * order to have the final state of the text being displayed.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @sample androidx.compose.foundation.samples.BasicTextFieldWithStringSample
 *
 * Please keep in mind that [onValueChange] is useful to be informed about the latest state of the
 * text input by users, however it is generally not recommended to modify the value that you get
 * via [onValueChange] callback. Any change to this value may result in a context reset and end
 * up with input session restart. Such a scenario would cause glitches in the UI or text input
 * experience for users.
 *
 * This composable provides basic text editing functionality, however does not include any
 * decorations such as borders, hints/placeholder. A design system based implementation such as
 * Material Design Filled text field is typically what is needed to cover most of the needs. This
 * composable is designed to be used when a custom implementation for different design system is
 * needed.
 *
 * For example, if you need to include a hint in your TextField you can write a composable as below:
 * @sample androidx.compose.foundation.samples.PlaceholderBasicTextFieldSample
 *
 * @param value the input [String] text to be shown in the text field
 * @param onValueChange the callback that is triggered when the input service updates the text. An
 * updated text comes as a parameter of the callback
 * @param modifier optional [Modifier] for this text field.
 * @param textStyle Style configuration that applies at character level such as color, font etc.
 * @param keyboardOptions software keyboard options that contains configuration such as
 * [KeyboardType] and [ImeAction].
 * @param onImeActionPerformed Called when the input service requested an IME action. When the
 * input service emitted an IME action, this callback is called with the emitted IME action. Note
 * that this IME action may be different from what you specified in [imeAction].
 * @param visualTransformation The visual transformation filter for changing the visual
 * representation of the input. By default no visual transformation is applied.
 * @param onTextLayout Callback that is executed when a new text layout is calculated.
 * @param onTextInputStarted Callback that is executed when the initialization has done for
 * communicating with platform text input service, e.g. software keyboard on Android. Called with
 * [SoftwareKeyboardController] instance which can be used for requesting input show/hide software
 * keyboard.
 * @param cursorColor Color of the cursor. If [Color.Unspecified], there will be no cursor drawn
