Compose Material Icons

# Package androidx.compose.material.icons

This is the entry point for using Material Icons in Compose, designed to provide icons that match those described at [fonts.google.com/icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons).

## Icons

Material Icons are available in five styles. The icons are based on the core Material Design principles and metrics.

### Filled

Filled icons (previously the only available style, also known as the baseline style) are the default icon style.

* [Icons.Filled]

### Outlined

Outlined icons make use of a thin stroke and empty space inside for a lighter appearance.

* [Icons.Outlined]

### Rounded

Rounded icons use a corner radius that pairs well with brands that use heavier typography, curved logos, or circular elements to express their style.

* [Icons.Rounded]

### Two tone

Two tone icons display corners with straight edges, for a crisp style that remains legible even at smaller scales.

* [Icons.TwoTone]

### Sharp

Sharp icons display corners with straight edges, for a crisp style that remains legible even at smaller scales.
