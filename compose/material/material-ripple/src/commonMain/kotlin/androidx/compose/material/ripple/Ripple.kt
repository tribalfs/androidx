/**
 * Creates and [remember]s a Ripple using values provided by [RippleTheme].
 *
 * A Ripple is a Material implementation of [Indication] that expresses different [Interaction]s
 * by drawing ripple animations and state layers.
 *
 * A Ripple responds to [Interaction.Pressed] by starting a new [RippleAnimation], and
 * responds to other [Interaction]s by showing a fixed [StateLayer] with varying alpha values
 * depending on the [Interaction].
 *
 * If you are using MaterialTheme in your hierarchy, a Ripple will be used as the default
 * [Indication] inside components such as [androidx.compose.foundation.clickable] and
 * [androidx.compose.foundation.indication]. You can also manually provide Ripples through
 * [androidx.compose.foundation.LocalIndication] for the same effect if you are not using
 * MaterialTheme.
 *
 * You can also explicitly create a Ripple and provide it to components in order to change the
 * parameters from the default, such as to create an unbounded ripple with a fixed size.
 *
 * @param bounded If true, ripples are clipped by the bounds of the target layout. Unbounded
 * ripples always animate from the target layout center, bounded ripples animate from the touch
 * position.
 * @param radius the radius for the ripple. If [Dp.Unspecified] is provided then the size will be
 * calculated based on the target layout size.
 * @param color the color of the ripple. This color is usually the same color used by the text or
 * iconography in the component. This color will then have [RippleTheme.rippleAlpha] applied to
 * calculate the final color used to draw the ripple. If [Color.Unspecified] is provided the color
 * used will be [RippleTheme.defaultColor] instead.

/**
 * Represents the layer underneath the press ripple, that displays an overlay for states such as
 * [Interaction.Dragged].
 *
 * Typically, there should be both an 'incoming' and an 'outgoing' layer, so that when
 * transitioning between two states, the incoming of the new state, and the outgoing of the old
 * state can be displayed. However, because:
 *
 * a) the duration of these outgoing transitions are so short (mostly 15ms, which is less than 1
 * frame at 60fps), and hence are barely noticeable if they happen at the same time as an
 * incoming transition
 * b) two layers cause a lot of extra work, and related performance concerns
 *
 * We skip managing two layers, and instead only show one layer. The details for the
 * [AnimationSpec]s used are as follows:
 *
 * No state -> a state = incoming transition for the new state
 * A state -> a different state = incoming transition for the new state
 * A state -> no state = outgoing transition for the old state

 * @see IncomingStateLayerAnimationSpecs
