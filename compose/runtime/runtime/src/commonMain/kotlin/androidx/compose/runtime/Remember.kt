/**
 * [remember] a [mutableStateOf] [newValue] and update its value to [newValue] on each
 * recomposition of the [rememberUpdatedState] call.
 *
 * [rememberUpdatedState] should be used when parameters or values computed during composition
 * are referenced by a long-lived lambda or object expression. Recomposition will update the
 * resulting [State] without recreating the long-lived lambda or object, allowing that object to
 * persist without cancelling and resubscribing, or relaunching a long-lived operation that may
 * be expensive or prohibitive to recreate and restart.
 * This may be common when working with [DisposableEffect] or [LaunchedEffect], for example:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.runtime.samples.rememberUpdatedStateSampleWithDisposableEffect
 *
 * [LaunchedEffect]s often describe state machines that should not be reset and restarted if a
 * parameter or event callback changes, but they should have the current value available when
 * needed. For example:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.runtime.samples.rememberUpdatedStateSampleWithLaunchedTask
 *
 * By using [rememberUpdatedState] a composable function can update these operations in progress.
