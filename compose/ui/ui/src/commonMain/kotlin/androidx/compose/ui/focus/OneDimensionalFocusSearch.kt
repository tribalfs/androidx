/**
 * We use this comparator to sort the focus modifiers in place order.
 *
 * We want to visit the nodes in placement order instead of composition order.
 * This is because components like LazyList reuse nodes without re-composing them, but it always
 * re-places nodes that are reused.
 *
 * Instead of sorting the items, we could just look for the next largest place order index in linear
 * time. However if the next item is deactivated, not eligible for focus search or none of its
 * children are focusable we would have to backtrack and find the item with the next largest place
 * order index. This would be more expensive than sorting the items. In addition to this, sorting
 * the items makes the next focus search more efficient.
