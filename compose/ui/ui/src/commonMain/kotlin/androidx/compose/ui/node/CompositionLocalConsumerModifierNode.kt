/**
 * Returns the current value of [local] at the position in the composition hierarchy of this
 * modifier's attached layout node.
 *
 * CompositionLocals should only be read with [currentValueOf] during the main phase of your
 * modifier's operations. This main phase of a modifier is defined as the timeframe of your Modifier
 * after it has been [attached][Modifier.Node.onAttach] and before it is
 * [detached][Modifier.Node.onDetach]. The main phase is when you will receive calls to your
 * modifier's primary hooks like [DrawModifierNode.draw], [LayoutModifierNode.measure],
 * [PointerInputModifierNode.onPointerEvent], etc. Every callback of a modifier that influences the
 * composable and is called after `onAttach()` and before `onDetach()` is considered part of the
 * main phase.
 *
 * Unlike [CompositionLocal.current], reads via this function are not automatically tracked by
 * Compose. Modifiers are not able to recompose in the same way that a Composable can, and therefore
 * can't receive updates arbitrarily for a CompositionLocal.
 *
 * Avoid reading CompositionLocals in [onAttach()][Modifier.Node.onAttach] and
 * [onDetach()][Modifier.Node.onDetach]. These lifecycle callbacks only happen once, meaning that
 * any reads in a lifecycle event will yield the value of the CompositionLocal as it was during the
 * event, and then never again. This can lead to Modifiers using stale CompositionLocal values and
 * unexpected behaviors in the UI.
 *
 * This function will fail with an [IllegalStateException] if you attempt to read a CompositionLocal
 * before the node is [attached][Modifier.Node.onAttach] or after the node is
 * [detached][Modifier.Node.onDetach].
