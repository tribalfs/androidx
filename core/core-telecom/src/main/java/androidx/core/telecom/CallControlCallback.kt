 * All CallControlCallbacks are transactional, meaning that a client must
 * complete the suspend fun with a [Boolean] response in order to complete the
 * CallControlCallback. If the operation has been completed, the [suspend fun] should return

 * CallControlCallback cannot be completed on the client side.

 * Note: Each CallEventCallback has a timeout of 5000 milliseconds. Failing to complete the
 * suspend fun before the timeout will result in a failed transaction.
