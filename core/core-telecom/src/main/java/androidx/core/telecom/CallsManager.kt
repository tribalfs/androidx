/**
 * CallsManager allows VoIP applications to add their calls to the Android system service Telecom.
 * By doing this, other services are aware of your VoIP application calls which leads to a more
 * stable environment. For example, a wearable may be able to answer an incoming call from your
 * application if the call is added to the Telecom system.  VoIP applications that manage calls and
 * do not inform the Telecom system may experience issues with resources (ex. microphone access).
 *
 * Note that access to some telecom information is permission-protected. Your app cannot access the
 * protected information or gain access to protected functionality unless it has the appropriate
 * permissions declared in its manifest file. Where permissions apply, they are noted in the method
 * descriptions.
