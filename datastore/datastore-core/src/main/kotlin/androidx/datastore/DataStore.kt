/**
 * DataStore provides a safe and durable way to store small amounts of data, such as preferences
 * and application state. It does not support partial updates: if any field is modified, the whole
 * object will be serialized and persisted to disk. If you want partial updates, consider the Room
 * API (SQLite).
 *
 * DataStore provides ACID guarantees. It is thread-safe, and non-blocking. In particular, it
 * addresses these design shortcomings of the SharedPreferences API:
 *
 * 1. Synchronous API encourages StrictMode violations
 * 2. apply() and commit() have no mechanism of signalling errors
 * 3. apply() will block the UI thread on fsync()
 * 4. Not durable â€“ it can returns state that is not yet persisted
 * 5. No consistency or transactional semantics
 * 6. Throws runtime exception on parsing errors
 * 7. Exposes mutable references to its internal state

     * again.
     *
     * Do not layer a cache on top of this API: it will be be impossible to
