    Simplifies a build.log from hundreds of megabytes to <100 lines. Prints output to terminal.
    Pass this script a filepath to parse. You should be able to type "python3 build_log_simplifier.py"
    And then drag-and-drop a log file onto the terminal window to get its path.

    Sample usage: python3 development/build_log_simplifier.py Users/owengray/Desktop/build.log
