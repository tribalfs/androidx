            AbsListView sets a list item to be clickable if the focusable is not explicitly set.
            This has effect of list items showing up as numbered when Voice access is activated
            (even if they don't have any click listeners). See ListItemAccessibilityDelegate. In
            order to prevent this, we explicitly set focusable as true here.
