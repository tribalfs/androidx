/**
 * Class responsible for supporting a "front buffered" rendering system. This allows for lower
 * latency graphics by leveraging a combination of front buffered and multi buffered content
 * layers.
 * Active content is rendered first into the front buffered layer which is simultaneously being
 * presented to the display. Periodically content is rendered into the multi buffered layer which
 * will have more traditional latency guarantees, however, minimize the impact of visual artifacts
 * due to graphical tearing.
 *
 * @param surfaceView Target SurfaceView to act as the parent rendering layer for multi buffered
 *  content
 * @param callback Callbacks used to render into front and multi buffered layers as well as
 *  configuring [SurfaceControlCompat.Transaction]s for controlling these layers in addition to
 *  other [SurfaceControlCompat] instances that must be updated atomically within the user
 *  interface. These callbacks are invoked on the backing GL Thread.
 * @param glRenderer Optional [GLRenderer] instance that this [GLFrontBufferedRenderer] should use
 *  for coordinating requests to render content. If this parameter is specified, the caller
 *  of this API is responsible for releasing resources on [GLRenderer] by calling
 *  [GLRenderer.stop]. Otherwise [GLFrontBufferedRenderer] will create and manage its own
 *  [GLRenderer] internally and will automatically release its resources within
 *  [GLFrontBufferedRenderer.release]
