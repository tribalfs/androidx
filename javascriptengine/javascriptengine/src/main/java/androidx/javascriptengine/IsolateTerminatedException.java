/**
 * Exception produced when evaluation is terminated due to the {@link JavaScriptIsolate} being
 * closed or due to some crash.
 * <p>
 * Calling {@link JavaScriptIsolate#close()} will cause this exception to be produced for all
 * previously requested but pending evaluations.
 * <p>
 * If an isolate has crashed (but not been closed), subsequently requested evaluations will fail
 * immediately with an IsolateTerminatedException (or a subclass) consistent with that
 * used for evaluations submitted before the crash.
 * <p>
 * Note that this exception will not be produced if the isolate has been explicitly closed before a
 * call to {@link JavaScriptIsolate#evaluateJavaScriptAsync(String)}, which will instead immediately
 * throw an IllegalStateException (and not asynchronously via a future). This applies even if the
 * isolate was closed following a crash.
 * <p>
 * Do not attempt to parse the information in this exception's message as it may change between
 * JavaScriptEngine versions.
 * <p>
 * Note that it is possible for an isolate to crash outside of submitted evaluations, in which
 * case an IsolateTerminatedException may not be observed. Consider instead using
 * {@link JavaScriptIsolate#addOnTerminatedCallback(Executor, Consumer)} if you need to reliably
 * or immediately detect isolate crashes rather than evaluation failures.
