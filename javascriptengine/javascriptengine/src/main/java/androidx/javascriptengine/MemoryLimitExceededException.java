/**
 * Indicates that a JavaScriptIsolate's evaluation failed due to exceeding its heap size limit.
 * <p>
 * This exception may be thrown when exceeding the heap size limit configured for the isolate via
 * {@link IsolateStartupParameters}, or the default limit. Beware that it will not be thrown if the
 * Android system as a whole has run out of memory before the JavaScript environment has reached
 * its configured heap limit.
 * <p>
 * The isolate may not continue to be used after this exception has been thrown, and other pending
 * evaluations for the isolate will fail. The isolate may continue to hold onto resources (even if
 * explicitly closed) until the sandbox has been shutdown. Therefore, it is recommended that the
 * sandbox be restarted at the earliest opportunity in order to reclaim these resources.
 * <p>
 * Other isolates within the same sandbox may continue to be used, created, and closed as normal.
 * <p>
 * Beware that not all JavaScript sandbox service implementations (particularly older ones)
 * handle memory exhaustion equally gracefully, and may instead crash the entire sandbox (see
 * {@link SandboxDeadException}).
