Library Project including media protocol declarations.

This library contains declarations for protocols used by
applications to communicate with services provided by media
routes.  For example, the MediaPlayerProtocol defines a protocol
by which an application may enqueue content to play on a
remote media device.

There is technically no source, but the src folder is necessary
to ensure that the build system works.  The content is actually
located in libs/android-support-media-protocols.jar.
