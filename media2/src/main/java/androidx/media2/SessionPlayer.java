/**
 * Base interface for all media players that want media session.
 * <p>
 * APIs that return {@link ListenableFuture} should be the asynchronous calls and shouldn't block
 * the calling thread. This guarantees the APIs are safe to be called on the main thread.
 *
 * <p>Topics covered here are:
 * <ol>
 * <li><a href="#BestPractices">Best practices</a>
 * <li><a href="#PlayerStates">Player states</a>
 * <li><a href="#InvalidStates">Invalid method calls</a>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3 id="BestPractices">Best practices</h3>
 *
 * Here are best practices when implementing/using SessionPlayer:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>When updating UI, you should respond to {@link PlayerCallback} invocations instead of
 * {@link PlayerResult} objects since the player can be controlled by others.
 * <li>When a SessionPlayer object is no longer being used, call {@link #close()} as soon as
 * possible to release the resources used by the internal player engine associated with the
 * SessionPlayer. For example, if a player uses hardware decoder, other player instances may
 * fallback to software decoders or fail to play. You cannot use SessionPlayer instance after
 * you call {@link #close()}. There is no way to reuse the instance.
 * <li>The current playback position can be retrieved with a call to {@link #getCurrentPosition()},
 * which is helpful for applications such as a music player that need to keep track of the playback
 * progress.
 * <li>The playback position can be adjusted with a call to {@link #seekTo(long)}. Although the
 * asynchronous {@link #seekTo} call returns right away, the actual seek operation may take a
 * while to finish, especially for audio/video being streamed.
 * <li>You can call {@link #seekTo(long)} from the {@link #PLAYER_STATE_PAUSED}. In these cases, if
 * you are playing a video stream and the requested position is valid, one video frame may be
 * displayed.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3 id="PlayerStates">Player states</h3>
 * The playback control of audio/video files is managed as a state machine. The SessionPlayer
 * defines four states:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>{@link #PLAYER_STATE_IDLE}: Initial state after the instantiation.
 *         <p>
 *         While in this state, you should call {@link #setMediaItem(MediaItem)} or
 *         {@link #setPlaylist(List, MediaMetadata)}. Check returned {@link ListenableFuture} for
 *         potential error.
 *         <p>
 *         Calling {@link #prepare()} transfers this object to {@link #PLAYER_STATE_PAUSED}.
 *
 *     <li>{@link #PLAYER_STATE_PAUSED}: State when the audio/video playback is paused.
 *         <p>
 *         Call {@link #play()} to resume or start playback from the position where it paused.
 *
 *     <li>{@link #PLAYER_STATE_PLAYING}: State when the player plays the media item.
 *         <p>
 *         In this state, {@link PlayerCallback#onBufferingStateChanged(
 *         SessionPlayer, MediaItem, int)} will be called regularly to tell the buffering status.
 *         <p>
 *         Playback state would remain {@link #PLAYER_STATE_PLAYING} when the currently playing
 *         media item is changed.
 *         <p>
 *         When the playback reaches the end of stream, the behavior depends on repeat mode, set by
 *         {@link #setRepeatMode(int)}. If the repeat mode was set to {@link #REPEAT_MODE_NONE},
 *         the player will transfer to the {@link #PLAYER_STATE_PAUSED}. Otherwise, the
 *         SessionPlayer object remains in the {@link #PLAYER_STATE_PLAYING} and playback will be
 *         ongoing.
 *
 *     <li>{@link #PLAYER_STATE_ERROR}: State when the playback failed and player cannot be
 *         recovered by itself.
 *         <p>
 *         In general, playback might fail due to various reasons such as unsupported audio/video
 *         format, poorly interleaved audio/video, resolution too high, streaming timeout, and
 *         others. In addition, due to programming errors, a playback control operation might be
 *         performed from an <a href="#InvalidStates">invalid state</a>. In these cases the player
 *         may transition to this state.
 * </ol>
 * Subclasses may have extra methods to reset the player state to {@link #PLAYER_STATE_IDLE} from
 * other states. Take a look at documentations of specific subclass that you're interested in.
 * <p>
 *
 * <h3 id="InvalidStates">Invalid method calls</h3>
 * The only method you safely call from the {@link #PLAYER_STATE_ERROR} is {@link #close()}.
 * Any other methods might return meaningless data.
 * <p>
 * Subclasses of the SessionPlayer may have extra methods that are safe to be called in the error
 * state and/or provide a method to recover from the error state. Take a look at documentations of
 * specific subclass that you're interested in.
 * <p>
 * Most methods can be called from any non-Error state. In case they're called in invalid state,
 * the implementation should ignore and would return {@link PlayerResult} with
 * {@link PlayerResult#RESULT_ERROR_INVALID_STATE}. The following table lists the methods that
 * aren't guaranteed to successfully running if they're called from the associated invalid states.
 * <p>
 * <table>
 * <tr><th>Method Name</th> <th>Invalid States</th></tr>
 * <tr><td>setAudioAttributes</td> <td>{Paused, Playing}</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>prepare</td> <td>{Paused, Playing}</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>play</td> <td>{Idle}</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>pause</td> <td>{Idle}</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>seekTo</td> <td>{Idle}</td></tr>
