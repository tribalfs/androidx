 * A PagedList is a lazy loaded list, which presents data from a {@link DataSource}. If the
 * DataSource is counted (returns a valid number from {@link DataSource#loadCount()}), the PagedList
 * will present null items at the beginning and end of loaded content. As {@link #loadAround} is
 * called, items will be added to the beginning or end of the list as appropriate, and if nulls are
 * present, a corresponding number will be removed.
 * <p>
 * In this way, PagedList can present data for an infinite scrolling list, or a very large but
 * countable list. See {@link PagedListAdapter}, which enables the binding of a PagedList to a
 * RecyclerView. Use {@link Config} to control how a PagedList loads content.
