/**
 * Lazy loading list that pages in immutable content from a [PagedSource].
 *
 * A [PagedList] is a [List] which loads its data in chunks (pages) from a [PagedSource]. Items can
 * be accessed with [get], and further loading can be triggered with [loadAround]. To display a
 * [PagedList], see [androidx.paging.PagedListAdapter], which enables the binding of a [PagedList]
 * to a [androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView].
 *
 * <h4>Loading Data</h4>
 *
 * All data in a [PagedList] is loaded from its [PagedSource]. Creating a [PagedList] loads the
 * first chunk of data from the [PagedSource] immediately, and should for this reason be done on a
 * background thread. The constructed [PagedList] may then be passed to and used on the UI thread.
 * This is done to prevent passing a list with no loaded content to the UI thread, which should
 * generally not be presented to the user.
 *
 * A [PagedList] initially presents this first partial load as its content, and expands over time as
 * content is loaded in. When [loadAround] is called, items will be loaded in near the passed
 * list index. If placeholder `null`s are present in the list, they will be replaced as
 * content is loaded. If not, newly loaded items will be inserted at the beginning or end of the
 * list.
 *
 * [PagedList] can present data for an unbounded, infinite scrolling list, or a very large but
 * countable list. Use [Config] to control how many items a [PagedList] loads, and when.
 *
 * If you use [androidx.paging.LivePagedListBuilder] to get a [androidx.lifecycle.LiveData], it will
 * initialize [PagedList]s on a background thread for you.
 *
 * <h4>Placeholders</h4>
 *
 * There are two ways that [PagedList] can represent its not-yet-loaded data - with or without
 * `null` placeholders.
 *
 * With placeholders, the [PagedList] is always the full size of the data set. `get(N)` returns
 * the `N`th item in the data set, or `null` if its not yet loaded.
 *
 * Without `null` placeholders, the [PagedList] is the sublist of data that has already been
 * loaded. The size of the [PagedList] is the number of currently loaded items, and `get(N)`
 * returns the `N`th *loaded* item. This is not necessarily the `N`th item in the
 * data set.
 *
 * Placeholders have several benefits:
 *
 *  * They express the full sized list to the presentation layer (often a
 * [androidx.paging.PagedListAdapter]), and so can support scrollbars (without jumping as pages are
 * loaded or dropped) and fast-scrolling to any position, loaded or not.
 *  * They avoid the need for a loading spinner at the end of the loaded list, since the list
 * is always full sized.
 *
 * They also have drawbacks:
 *
 *  * Your Adapter needs to account for `null` items. This often means providing default
 * values in data you bind to a [androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView.ViewHolder].
 *  * They don't work well if your item views are of different sizes, as this will prevent
 * loading items from cross-fading nicely.
 *  * They require you to count your data set, which can be expensive or impossible, depending
 * on your [PagedSource].
 *
 * Placeholders are enabled by default, but can be disabled in two ways. They are disabled if the
 * [PagedSource] does not count its data set in its initial load, or if  `false` is passed to * [Config.Builder.setEnablePlaceholders] when building a [Config].
 *
 * <h4>Mutability and Snapshots</h4>
 *
 * A [PagedList] is *mutable* while loading, or ready to load from its [PagedSource].
 * As loads succeed, a mutable [PagedList] will be updated via Runnables on the main thread. You can
 * listen to these updates with a [Callback]. (Note that [androidx.paging.PagedListAdapter] will
 * listen to these to signal RecyclerView about the updates/changes).
 *
 * If a [PagedList] attempts to load from an invalid [PagedSource], it will [detach] from the
 * [PagedSource], meaning that it will no longer attempt to load data. It will return true from
 * [isImmutable], and a new [PagedSource] / [PagedList] pair must be created to load further data.
 *
 * See [PagedSource] and [androidx.paging.LivePagedListBuilder] for how new [PagedList]s are created
 * to represent changed data.
 *
 * A [PagedList] snapshot is simply an immutable shallow copy of the current state of the
 * [PagedList] as a `List`. It will reference the same inner items, and contain the same `null`
 * placeholders, if present.
 *
 * @param T The type of the entries in the list.

    /**
     * Signals when a PagedList has reached the end of available data.
     *
     * When local storage is a cache of network data, it's common to set up a streaming pipeline:
     * Network data is paged into the database, database is paged into UI. Paging from the database
     * to UI can be done with a `LiveData<PagedList>`, but it's still necessary to know when to
     * trigger network loads.
     *
     * [BoundaryCallback] does this signaling - when a [PagedSource] runs out of data at the end of
     * the list, [onItemAtEndLoaded] is called, and you can start an async network load that will
     * write the result directly to the database. Because the database is being observed, the UI
     * bound to the `LiveData<PagedList>` will update automatically to account for the new items.
     *
     * Note that a BoundaryCallback instance shared across multiple PagedLists (e.g. when passed to
     * [androidx.paging.LivePagedListBuilder.setBoundaryCallback], the callbacks may be issued
     * multiple times. If for example [onItemAtEndLoaded] triggers a network load, it should avoid
     * triggering it again while the load is ongoing.
     *
     * The database + network Repository in the
     * [PagingWithNetworkSample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/blob/master/PagingWithNetworkSample/README.md)
     * shows how to implement a network BoundaryCallback using
     * [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/), while handling swipe-to-refresh,
     * network errors, and retry.
     *
     * <h4>Requesting Network Data</h4>
     * [BoundaryCallback] only passes the item at front or end of the list when out of data. This
     * makes it an easy fit for item-keyed network requests, where you can use the item passed to
     * the [BoundaryCallback] to request more data from the network. In these cases, the source of
     * truth for next page to load is coming from local storage, based on what's already loaded.
     *
     * If you aren't using an item-keyed network API, you may be using page-keyed, or page-indexed.
     * If this is the case, the paging library doesn't know about the page key or index used in the
     * [BoundaryCallback], so you need to track it yourself. You can do this in one of two ways:
     *
     * <h5>Local storage Page key</h5>
     * If you want to perfectly resume your query, even if the app is killed and resumed, you can
     * store the key on disk. Note that with a positional/page index network API, there's a simple
     * way to do this, by using the `listSize` as an input to the next load (or
     * `listSize / NETWORK_PAGE_SIZE`, for page indexing).
     *
     * The current list size isn't passed to the BoundaryCallback though. This is because the
     * PagedList doesn't necessarily know the number of items in local storage. Placeholders may be
     * disabled, or the [PagedSource] may not count total number of items.
     *
     * Instead, for these positional cases, you can query the database for the number of items, and
     * pass that to the network.
     * <h5>In-Memory Page key</h5>
     * Often it doesn't make sense to query the next page from network if the last page you fetched
     * was loaded many hours or days before. If you keep the key in memory, you can refresh any time
     * you start paging from a network source.
     *
     * Store the next key in memory, inside your BoundaryCallback. When you create a new
     * BoundaryCallback when creating a new `LiveData`/`Observable` of
     * `PagedList`, refresh data. For example,
     * [in the Paging Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-paging/index.html#8),
     * the GitHub network page index is stored in memory.
