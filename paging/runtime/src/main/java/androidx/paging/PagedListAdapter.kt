/**
 * [RecyclerView.Adapter] base class for presenting paged data from [androidx.paging.PagedList]s in
 * a [RecyclerView].
 *
 * This class is a convenience wrapper around [AsyncPagedListDiffer] that implements common default
 * behavior for item counting, and listening to PagedList update callbacks.
 *
 * While using a LiveData<PagedList> is an easy way to provide data to the adapter, it isn't
 * required - you can use [submitList] when new lists are available.
 *
 * PagedListAdapter listens to PagedList loading callbacks as pages are loaded, and uses DiffUtil on
 * a background thread to compute fine grained updates as new PagedLists are received.
 *
 * Handles both the internal paging of the list as more data is loaded, and updates in the form of
 * new PagedLists.
 *
 * A complete usage pattern with Room would look like this:
 * ```
 * @Dao
 *     interface UserDao {
 *     @Query("SELECT * FROM user ORDER BY lastName ASC")
 *     public abstract DataSource.Factory<Integer, User> usersByLastName();
 * }
 *
 * class MyViewModel extends ViewModel {
 *     public final LiveData<PagedList<User>> usersList;
 *     public MyViewModel(UserDao userDao) {
 *         usersList = new LivePagedListBuilder&lt;>(
 *         userDao.usersByLastName(), /* page size */ 20).build();
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * class MyActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
 *     @Override
 *     public void onCreate(Bundle savedState) {
 *         super.onCreate(savedState);
 *         MyViewModel viewModel = new ViewModelProvider(this).get(MyViewModel.class);
 *         RecyclerView recyclerView = findViewById(R.id.user_list);
 *         UserAdapter&lt;User> adapter = new UserAdapter();
 *         viewModel.usersList.observe(this, pagedList -> adapter.submitList(pagedList));
 *         recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter);
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * class UserAdapter extends PagedListAdapter<User, UserViewHolder> {
 *     public UserAdapter() {
 *         super(DIFF_CALLBACK);
 *     }
 *     @Override
 *     public void onBindViewHolder(UserViewHolder holder, int position) {
 *         User user = getItem(position);
 *         if (user != null) {
 *             holder.bindTo(user);
 *         } else {
 *             // Null defines a placeholder item - PagedListAdapter will automatically invalidate
 *             // this row when the actual object is loaded from the database
 *             holder.clear();
 *         }
 *     }
 *     public static final DiffUtil.ItemCallback&lt;User> DIFF_CALLBACK =
 *             new DiffUtil.ItemCallback<User>() {
 *         @Override
 *         public boolean areItemsTheSame(@NonNull User oldUser, @NonNull User newUser) {
 *             // User properties may have changed if reloaded from the DB, but ID is fixed
 *             return oldUser.getId() == newUser.getId();
 *         }
 *         @Override
 *         public boolean areContentsTheSame(@NonNull User oldUser, @NonNull User newUser) {
 *             // NOTE: if you use equals, your object must properly override Object#equals()
 *             // Incorrectly returning false here will result in too many animations.
 *             return oldUser.equals(newUser);
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Advanced users that wish for more control over adapter behavior, or to provide a specific base
 * class should refer to [AsyncPagedListDiffer], which provides the mapping from paging
 * events to adapter-friendly callbacks.
 *
 * @param T Type of the PagedLists this Adapter will receive.
 * @param VH A class that extends ViewHolder that will be used by the adapter.
