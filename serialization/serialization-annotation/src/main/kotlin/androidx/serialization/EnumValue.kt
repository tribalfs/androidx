/**
 * Tags a serializable enum value with its serialized ID.
 *
 * A serializable enum must have this annotation on all its values. One value of the enum must be
 * selected as the default value to use if the enum value is unrecognized or missing. Set the ID
 * of this value to [DEFAULT] or zero.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * enum class MyEnum {
 *    @EnumValue(EnumValue.DEFAULT)
 *    DEFAULT,
 *
 *    @EnumValue(1)
 *    MY_VALUE
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @property id Integer ID of the enum value.
 *
 * Any integer is a valid enum value ID, but `0` has special meaning as the default value.
 * Additionally, negative values are not recommended as their proto representation is always 10
 * bytes long.
 *
 * Enum value IDs must be unique within an enum class, but may be freely reused between enum
 * classes.
 *
 * To reserve enum value IDs for future use or to prevent unintentional reuse of removed enum
 * value IDs, apply the [Reserved] annotation to the enum class.
