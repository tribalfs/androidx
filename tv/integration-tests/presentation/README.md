# Presentation app

## Setup

* Uncomment the `coil` and `gson` libraries dependency additions from the `build.gradle` file.
* Uncomment the function content and imports from
  `presentation/src/main/java/androidx/tv/integration/presentation/ExternalLibs.kt` file
* Create the `data.json` file in `presentation/src/main/assets` directory and add the content from
  this link: go/compose-tv-presentation-app-data

> If you are not a Googler and want to use this app for
> testing, you will have to create the `data.json` file by following the schema mentioned in the
`Data.kt` file
