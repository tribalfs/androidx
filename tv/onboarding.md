   * [tv-material][tv-material]
3. Refer to the documentation and examples on [developer.android.com][dac].
4. Get up to speed with the [codelabs][codelabs].
5. Find the sample app on [GitHub][github-sample-app].

## If you run into issues

   and Jetpack compose.
2. Read the FAQs below.
3. Check with the community over on  [stack overflow][stackoverflow].
4. Check if there is a bug already reported on [issue-tracker][issue-tracker].
5. File a bug on [issue-tracker][issue-tracker-file-a-bug].
6. Reach out to a Google Developer Relations partner who can, if necessary, bring in someone from the engineering team.

## FAQs

1. ### How can I improve the performance of my app written using tv-compose?
   * [Performance improvements][improve-performance] suggested for a Compose app would typically apply to apps built with Compose for TV libraries as well.
   * Use [baseline profiles][baseline-profiles] as recommended
     in [Jetpack Compose Performance guide][jetpack-compose-performance].
     Watch [Making apps blazing fast with Baseline Profiles][making-apps-blazing-fast-with-baseline-profiles].
   * Check out [Interpreting Compose Compiler Metrics][interpreting-compose-compiler-metrics].
2. ### My app is crashing!
   * Ensure that you are on the latest version.
     of [Compose for TV libraries][compose-for-tv-libraries] and Jetpack Compose
   * Check if there is a bug already reported on [issue-tracker][issue-tracker].
   * [File a bug on issue-tracker][issue-tracker-file-a-bug].
3. ### The Navigation drawer is pushing my content aside. I donâ€™t like it.
   Consider using a [Modal Navigation Drawer][modal-navigation-drawer] provided
   in [Compose for TV library][compose-for-tv-modal-navigation-drawer].
4. ### Sideloading baseline profiles to test performance, without releasing the app.
   Refer to the steps for [applying baseline profiles][tv-samples-baseline-profiles] in the
   Jetstream sample app.
