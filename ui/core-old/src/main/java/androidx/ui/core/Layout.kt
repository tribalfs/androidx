 * simpler API. [MeasureBox] is the recommended way of building custom layouts if your layout
 * hierarchy is not using intrinsic dimensions, or if the default behavior provided by [MeasureBox]
 * for its own intrinsic measurements is correct for your layout. To compute its own intrinsic
 * dimensions, [MeasureBox] reuses the lambda provided for the regular measurement and layout, but
 * replaces any occurence of [Measurable.measure] with a suitable intrinsic dimension calculation
 * of the child.
