/**
 * Immutable constraints used for measuring child [MeasureBox]es. A parent [MeasureBox]
 * can measure their children using the [measure] method on the corresponding [Measurable]s,
 * method which takes the [Constraints] the child has to follow. A [measure]d child is then
 * responsible to choose for themselves and return a size which satisfies the received set
 * of [Constraints]:
 * - minWidth <= chosenWidth <= maxWidth
 * - minHeight <= chosenHeight <= maxHeight
 * The parent can then access the child chosen size on the resulting [Placeable]. The parent is
 * responsible of defining a valid positioning of the children according to their sizes, so the
 * parent needs to measure the children with appropriate [Constraints], such that whatever valid
 * sizes children choose, they can be laid out in a way that also respects the parent's incoming
 * [Constraints]. Note that different children can be [measure]d with different [Constraints].
 * A set of [Constraints] can have infinite maxWidth and/or maxHeight. This is a trick often
 * used by parents to ask their children for their preferred size: unbounded constraints force
 * children whose default behavior is to fill the available space (always size to
 * maxWidth/maxHeight) to have an opinion about their preferred size. Most commonly, when measured
 * with unbounded [Constraints], these children will fallback to size themselves to wrap their
 * content, instead of expanding to fill the available space (this is not always true
 * as it depends on the child layout model, but is a common behavior for core layout components).
