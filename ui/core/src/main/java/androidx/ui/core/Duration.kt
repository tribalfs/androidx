/**
 * A span of time, such as 27 days, 4 hours, 12 minutes, and 3 seconds.
 *
 * A `Duration` represents a difference from one point in time to another. The
 * duration may be "negative" if the difference is from a later time to an
 * earlier.
 *
 * Durations are context independent. For example, a duration of 2 days is
 * always 48 hours, even when it is added to a `DateTime` just when the
 * time zone is about to do a daylight-savings switch. (See [DateTime.add]).
 *
 * Despite the same name, a `Duration` object does not implement "Durations"
 * as specified by ISO 8601. In particular, a duration object does not keep
 * track of the individually provided members (such as "days" or "hours"), but
 * only uses these arguments to compute the length of the corresponding time
 * interval.
 *
 * To create a new Duration object, use this class's single constructor
 * giving the appropriate arguments:
 *
 *     Duration fastestMarathon = new Duration(hours:2, minutes:3, seconds:2);
 *
 * The [Duration] is the sum of all individual parts.
 * This means that individual parts can be larger than the next-bigger unit.
 * For example, [inMinutes] can be greater than 59.
 *
 *     assert(fastestMarathon.inMinutes == 123);
 *
 * All individual parts are allowed to be negative.
 *
 * Use one of the properties, such as [inDays],
 * to retrieve the integer value of the Duration in the specified time unit.
 * Note that the returned value is rounded down.
 * For example,
 *
 *     Duration aLongWeekend = new Duration(hours:88);
 *     assert(aLongWeekend.inDays == 3);
 *
 * This class provides a collection of arithmetic
 * and comparison operators,
 * plus a set of constants useful for converting time units.
 *
 * See [DateTime] to represent a point in time.
 * See [Stopwatch] to measure time-spans.
