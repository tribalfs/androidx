/**
 * A convenience widget that combines common layout and painting widgets for one child:
 * - padding: the padding to be applied to the child
 * - color: the background color drawn under the padded child
 * - alignment: how to position the padded child if the [Container] is larger than the child
 * - constraints: additional constraints to be enforced when measuring the padded child
 * - width: the width to be enforced to the padded child
 * - height: the height to be enforced to the padded child
 * - margin: padding to be applied to the [Container] itself (the margin is not applied to the
 *   child). Note that the margin is not part of the given constraints, width or height arguments.
 *
 * The [Container] will be as large as possible for bounded constraints (after the given
 * constraints, width and height are considered) - if the padded child is smaller, the alignment
 * will be used to position it. For unbounded constraints, the [Container] will wrap its child.
 * Also, note that the measurement information passed for the [Container] (constraints, width
 * and height) will not be satisfied if the incoming [Constraints] do not allow
 * it.
