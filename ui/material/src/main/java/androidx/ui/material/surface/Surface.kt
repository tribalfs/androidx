/**
 * The [Surface] is responsible for:
 *
 * 1) Clipping: Surface clips its children to the shape specified by [shape]
 *
 * 2) Elevation: Surface elevates its children on the Z axis by [elevation] pixels,
 *   and draws the appropriate shadow.
 *
 * 3) Ripple effects: Surface shows [RippleEffect]s below its children.
 *
 * 4) Borders: If [shape] has a border, then it will also be drawn.
 *
 *
 * Material surface is the central metaphor in material design. Each surface
 * exists at a given elevation, which influences how that piece of surface
 * visually relates to other surfaces and how that surface casts shadows.
 *
 * Most user interface elements are either conceptually printed on a surface
 * or themselves made of surface. Surface reacts to user input using [RippleEffect] effects.
 * To trigger a reaction on the surface, use a [RippleSurfaceOwner] obtained via
 * [ambientRippleSurface].
 *
 * The text color for internal [Text] components will try to match the correlated color
 * for the background [color]. For example, on [MaterialColors.surface] background
 * [MaterialColors.onSurface] will be used for text. To modify these default style
 * values use [CurrentTextStyleProvider] or provide direct styling to your components.
 *
 * @param shape Defines the surface's shape as well its shadow. A shadow is only
 *  displayed if the [elevation] is greater than zero.
 * @param color The background color. [MaterialColors.surface] is used when null
 *  is provided. Use [TransparentSurface] to have no color.
 * @param border Optional border to draw on top of the shape.
 * @param elevation The z-coordinate at which to place this surface. This controls
 *  the size of the shadow below the surface.
