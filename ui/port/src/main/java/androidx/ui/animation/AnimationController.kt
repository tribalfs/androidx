/**
 * A controller for an animation.
 *
 * This class lets you perform tasks such as:
 *
 * * Play an animation [forward] or in [reverse], or [stop] an animation.
 * * Set the animation to a specific [value].
 * * Define the [upperBound] and [lowerBound] values of an animation.
 * * Create a [fling] animation effect using a physics simulation.
 *
 * By default, an [AnimationController] linearly produces values that range
 * from 0.0 to 1.0, during a given duration. The animation controller generates
 * a new value whenever the device running your app is ready to display a new
 * frame (typically, this rate is around 60 values per second).
 *
 * An AnimationController needs a [TickerProvider], which is configured using
 * the `vsync` argument on the constructor. If you are creating an
 * AnimationController from a [State], then you can use the
 * [TickerProviderStateMixin] and [SingleTickerProviderStateMixin] classes to
 * obtain a suitable [TickerProvider]. The widget test framework [WidgetTester]
 * object can be used as a ticker provider in the context of tests. In other
 * contexts, you will have to either pass a [TickerProvider] from a higher
 * level (e.g. indirectly from a [State] that mixes in
 * [TickerProviderStateMixin]), or create a custom [TickerProvider] subclass.
 *
 * The methods that start animations return a [TickerFuture] object which
 * completes when the animation completes successfully, and never throws an
 * error; if the animation is canceled, the future never completes. This object
 * also has a [TickerFuture.orCancel] property which returns a future that
 * completes when the animation completes successfully, and completes with an
 * error when the animation is aborted.
 *
 * This can be used to write code such as:
 *
 * ```dart
 * Future<Null> fadeOutAndUpdateState() async {
 *   try {
 *     await fadeAnimationController.forward().orCancel;
 *     await sizeAnimationController.forward().orCancel;
 *     setState(() {
 *       dismissed = true;
 *     });
 *   } on TickerCanceled {
 *     // the animation got canceled, probably because we were disposed
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ...which asynchronously runs one animation, then runs another, then changes
 * the state of the widget, without having to verify [State.mounted] is still
 * true at each step, and without having to chain futures together explicitly.
 * (This assumes that the controllers are created in [State.initState] and
 * disposed in [State.dispose].)
