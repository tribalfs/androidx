/**
 * An animation that applies a curve to another animation.
 *
 * [CurvedAnimation] is useful when you want to apply a non-linear [Curve] to
 * an animation object wrapped in the [CurvedAnimation].
 *
 * For example, the following code snippet shows how you can apply a curve to a
 * linear animation produced by an [AnimationController]:
 *
 * ``` dart
 *     final AnimationController controller =
 *         new AnimationController(duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500));
 *     final CurvedAnimation animation =
 *         new CurvedAnimation(parent: controller, curve: Curves.ease);
 *```
 * Depending on the given curve, the output of the [CurvedAnimation] could have
 * a wider range than its input. For example, elastic curves such as
 * [Curves.elasticIn] will significantly overshoot or undershoot the default
 * range of 0.0 to 1.0.
 *
 * If you want to apply a [Curve] to a [Tween], consider using [CurveTween].

    /** The curve to use in the forward direction. */
    private val curve: Curve,
    /**
     * The curve to use in the reverse direction.
     *
     * If the parent animation changes direction without first reaching the
     * [AnimationStatus.COMPLETED] or [AnimationStatus.DISMISSED] status, the
     * [CurvedAnimation] stays on the same curve (albeit in the opposite
     * direction) to avoid visual discontinuities.
     *
     * If you use a non-null [reverseCurve], you might want to hold this object
     * in a [State] object rather than recreating it each time your widget builds
     * in order to take advantage of the state in this object that avoids visual
     * discontinuities.
     *
     * If this field is null, uses [curve] in both directions.
