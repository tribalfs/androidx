/**
 * A class that can be extended or mixed in that provides a change notification
 * API using [VoidCallback] for notifications.
 *
 * [ChangeNotifier] is optimized for small numbers (one or two) of listeners.
 * It is O(N) for adding and removing listeners and O(NÂ²) for dispatching
 * notifications (where N is the number of listeners).
 *
 * See also:
 *
 *  * [ValueNotifier], which is a [ChangeNotifier] that wraps a single value.
