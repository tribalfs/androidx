// /// Base class for touch, stylus, or mouse events.
// ///
// /// Pointer events operate in the coordinate space of the screen, scaled to
// /// logical pixels. Logical pixels approximate a grid with about 38 pixels per
// /// centimeter, or 96 pixels per inch.
// ///
// /// This allows gestures to be recognized independent of the precise hardware
// /// characteristics of the device. In particular, features such as touch slop
// /// (see [kTouchSlop]) can be defined in terms of roughly physical lengths so
// /// that the user can shift their finger by the same distance on a high-density
// /// display as on a low-resolution device.
// ///
// /// For similar reasons, pointer events are not affected by any transforms in
// /// the rendering layer. This means that deltas may need to be scaled before
// /// being applied to movement within the rendering. For example, if a scrolling
// /// list is shown scaled by 2x, the pointer deltas will have to be scaled by the
// /// inverse amount if the list is to appear to scroll with the user"s finger.
// ///
// /// See also:
// ///
// ///  * [Window.devicePixelRatio], which defines the device"s current resolution.
