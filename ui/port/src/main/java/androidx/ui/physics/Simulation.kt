/**
 * The base class for all simulations.
 *
 * A simulation models an object, in a one-dimensional space, on which particular
 * forces are being applied, and exposes:
 *
 *  * The object's position, [x]
 *  * The object's velocity, [dx]
 *  * Whether the simulation is "done", [isDone]
 *
 * A simulation is generally "done" if the object has, to a given [tolerance],
 * come to a complete rest.
 *
 * The [x], [dx], and [isDone] functions take a time argument which specifies
 * the time for which they are to be evaluated. In principle, simulations can
 * be stateless, and thus can be queried with arbitrary times. In practice,
 * however, some simulations are not, and calling any of these functions will
 * advance the simulation to the given time.
 *
 * As a general rule, therefore, a simulation should only be queried using
 * times that are equal to or greater than all times previously used for that
 * simulation.
 *
 * Simulations do not specify units for distance, velocity, and time. Client
 * should establish a convention and use that convention consistently with all
 * related objects.
