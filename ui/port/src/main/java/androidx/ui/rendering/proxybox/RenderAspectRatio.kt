// /// The render object first tries the largest width permitted by the layout
// /// constraints. The height of the render object is determined by applying the
// /// given aspect ratio to the width, expressed as a ratio of width to height.
// ///
// /// For example, a 16:9 width:height aspect ratio would have a value of
// /// 16.0/9.0. If the maximum width is infinite, the initial width is determined
// /// by applying the aspect ratio to the maximum height.
// ///
// /// Now consider a second example, this time with an aspect ratio of 2.0 and
// /// layout constraints that require the width to be between 0.0 and 100.0 and
// /// the height to be between 0.0 and 100.0. We'll select a width of 100.0 (the
// /// biggest allowed) and a height of 50.0 (to match the aspect ratio).
// ///
// /// In that same situation, if the aspect ratio is 0.5, we'll also select a
// /// width of 100.0 (still the biggest allowed) and we'll attempt to use a height
// /// of 200.0. Unfortunately, that violates the constraints because the child can
// /// be at most 100.0 pixels tall. The render object will then take that value
// /// and apply the aspect ratio again to obtain a width of 50.0. That width is
// /// permitted by the constraints and the child receives a width of 50.0 and a
// /// height of 100.0. If the width were not permitted, the render object would
// /// continue iterating through the constraints. If the render object does not
// /// find a feasible size after consulting each constraint, the render object
// /// will eventually select a size for the child that meets the layout
