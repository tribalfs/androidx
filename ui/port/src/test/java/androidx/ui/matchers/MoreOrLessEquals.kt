/**
 * Asserts that two [Double]s are equal, within some tolerated error.
 *
 * Two values are considered equal if the difference between them is within
 * 1e-10 of the larger one. This is an arbitrary value which can be adjusted
 * using the `epsilon` argument. This matcher is intended to compare floating
 * point numbers that are the result of different sequences of operations, such
 * that they may have accumulated slightly different errors.
 *
 * See also:
 *
 *  * [closeTo], which is identical except that the epsilon argument is
 *    required and not named.
 *  * [InInclusiveRange], which matches if the argument is in a specified
 *    range.
