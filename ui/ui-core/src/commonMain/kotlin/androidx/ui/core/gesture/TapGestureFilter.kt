/**
 * This gesture detector fires a callback when a traditional press is being released.  This is
 * generally the same thing as "onTap" or "onClick".
 *
 * [onTap] is called with the position of the last pointer to go "up".
 *
 * More specifically, it will call [onTap] if:
 * - All of the first [PointerInputChange]s it receives during the [PointerEventPass.PostUp] pass
 *   have unconsumed down changes, thus representing new set of pointers, none of which have had
 *   their down events consumed.
 * - The last [PointerInputChange] it receives during the [PointerEventPass.PostUp] pass has
 *   an unconsumed up change.
 * - While it has at least one pointer touching it, no [PointerInputChange] has had any
 *   movement consumed (as that would indicate that something in the heirarchy moved and this a
 *   press should be cancelled.
 * - It also fully cooperates with [DelayUpEvent] [CustomEvent]s it receives such that it will delay
 *   calling [onTap] if all of it's up events are being blocked.  If it was being blocked and later
 *   is allowed to fire it's up event (which is [onTap]) it will do so and consume the delayed up
 *   custom event such that no other gesture filters will also respond to the delayed up.
 *
 *   @param onTap Called when a tap has occurred.
