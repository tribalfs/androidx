/**
 * This composable can be used to create components that are Focusable. A component that is focused
 * receives any invoked actions. Some examples of actions are 'paste' (receiving the
 * contents of the clipboard), or receiving text from the keyboard.
 *
 * [Focusable] components have access to the current focus state. The children of a [Focusable]
 * have access to this focus state during composition.
 *
 * [focusOperator] : This object is returned in the receiver scope of the components
 * passed as [children]. You should not specify this parameter unless you want to hoist the
 * focusOperator so that you can control the focusable from outside the scope of its children.
 *
 * [children]: This is a composable block called with [focusOperator] in its receiver scope.
 * Children can use [FocusOperator.focusState] for conditional composition.
