/**
 * A layout composable that places its children in a horizontal sequence. For a layout composable
 * that places its children in a vertical sequence, see [Column].
 *
 * The layout model is able to assign children widths according to their weights provided
 * using the [RowScope.weight] modifier. If a child is not provided a weight, it will be
 * asked for its preferred width before the sizes of the children with weights are calculated
 * proportionally to their weight based on the remaining available space.
 *
 * When none of its children have weights, a [Row] will be as small as possible to fit its
 * children one next to the other. In order to change the width of the [Row], use the
 * [Modifier.width] modifiers; e.g. to make it fill the available width [Modifier.fillMaxWidth]
 * can be used. If at least one child of a [Row] has a [weight][RowScope.weight], the [Row] will
 * fill the available width, so there is no need for [Modifier.fillMaxWidth]. However, if [Row]'s
 * size should be limited, the [Modifier.width] or [Modifier.size] layout modifiers should be
 * applied.
 *
 * When the size of the [Row] is larger than the sum of its children sizes, a
 * [horizontalArrangement] can be specified to define the positioning of the children inside
 * the [Row]. See [Arrangement] for available positioning behaviors; a custom arrangement can
 * also be defined using the constructor of [Arrangement].
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * @sample androidx.ui.layout.samples.SimpleRow
 *
 * @param modifier The modifier to be applied to the Row.
 * @param horizontalArrangement The horizontal arrangement of the layout's children.
 * @param verticalGravity The vertical gravity of the layout's children.
 *
 * @see Column
