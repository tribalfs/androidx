/**
 * A MaterialTheme defines the styling principles from the Material design specification.
 *
 * Material components such as [Button] and [Checkbox] use values provided here when retrieving
 * default values.
 *
 * It defines colors as specified in the [Material Color theme creation spec](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-theme-creation),
 * typography defined in the [Material Type Scale spec](https://material.io/design/typography/the-type-system.html#type-scale),
 * and shapes defined in the [Shape scheme](https://material.io/design/shape/applying-shape-to-ui.html#shape-scheme).
 *
 * All values may be set by providing this component with the [colors][ColorPalette],
 * [typography][Typography], and [shapes][Shapes] attributes. Use this to configure the overall
 * theme of elements within this MaterialTheme.
 *
 * Any values that are not set will inherit the current value from the theme, falling back to the
 * defaults if there is no parent MaterialTheme. This allows using a MaterialTheme at the top
 * of your application, and then separate MaterialTheme(s) for different screens / parts of your
 * UI, overriding only the parts of the theme definition that need to change.
 *
 * @sample androidx.ui.material.samples.MaterialThemeSample
 *
 * @param colors A complete definition of the Material Color theme for this hierarchy
 * @param typography A set of text styles to be used as this hierarchy's typography system
 * @param shapes A set of shapes to be used by the components in this hierarchy
