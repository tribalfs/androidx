/**
 * This component defines the styling principles from the Material design specification. It must be
 * present within a hierarchy of components that includes Material components, as it defines key
 * values such as base colors and typography.
 *
 * Material components such as [Button] and [Checkbox] use this definition to set default values.
 *
 * It defines colors as specified in the [Material Color theme creation spec](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-theme-creation)
 * and the typography defined in the [Material Type Scale spec](https://material.io/design/typography/the-type-system.html#type-scale).
 *
 * All values may be set by providing this component with the [colors][ColorPalette] and
 * [typography][Typography] attributes. Use this to configure the overall theme of your
 * application.
 *
 * @sample androidx.ui.material.samples.MaterialThemeSample
 *
 * @param colors A complete definition of the Material Color theme for this hierarchy
 * @param typography A set of text styles to be used as this hierarchy's typography system
