/**
 * Effect to create special version if [AnimatedFloatDragController] that maps
 * float anchors to states
 *
 * Alongside with control that [AnimatedFloatDragController] provides, this component ensures that:
 * 1. The AnimatedFloat value will be in sync with call site state
 * 2. When the anchor is reached, [onStateChange] will be called with state mapped to this anchor
 * 3. When the anchor is reached and [onStateChange] with corresponding state is called, but
 * call site didn't update state to the reached one for some reason,
 * this component performs rollback to the previous (correct) state.
 * 4. When new [state] is provided, component will be animated to state's anchor
 *
 * @param T type with which state is represented
 * @param state current state to represent Float value with
 * @param onStateChange callback to update call site's state
 * @param anchorsToState pairs of anchors to states to map anchors to state and vise versa
 * @param animationBuilder animation which will be used for animations
 * @return pair of controller and callback to pass to [Draggable].
