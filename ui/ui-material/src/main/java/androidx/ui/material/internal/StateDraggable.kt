/**
 * Higher-level [Draggable] component that has anchored positions bindid to different states
 *
 * Example might be a Switch which you can drag between two states (true or false).
 *
 * Additional features compared to regular [Draggable]
 * 1. The AnimatedFloat hosted inside and its value will be in sync with call site state
 * 2. When the anchor is reached, [onStateChange] will be called with state mapped to this anchor
 * 3. When the anchor is reached and [onStateChange] with corresponding state is called, but
 * call site didn't update state to the reached one for some reason,
 * this component performs rollback to the previous (correct) state.
 * 4. When new [state] is provided, component will be animated to state's anchor
 *
 * children of this composable will receive [ValueHolder] class from which
 * they can read current value when they need.
 *
 * @param T type with which state is represented
 * @param state current state to represent Float value with
 * @param onStateChange callback to update call site's state
 * @param anchorsToState pairs of anchors to states to map anchors to state and vise versa
 * @param animationBuilder animation which will be used for animations
 * @param dragDirection direction in which drag should be happening.
 * Either [DragDirection.Vertical] or [DragDirection.Horizontal]
 * @param minValue lower bound for draggable value in this component
 * @param maxValue upper bound for draggable value in this component
 * @param enabled whether or not this Draggable is enabled and should consume events
