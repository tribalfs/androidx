        Theme in the "Platform.AppCompat" family are designed to be aliases for the default
        theme on a given platform version. They should not set any styleable attributes. Instead
        you should create a "Theme.Base" theme which inherits from a "Platform" theme.

        As we have defined the theme in values-large (for compat) and values-large takes precedence
        over values-v14, we need to reset back to the Holo parent in values-large-v14. As the themes
        in values-v14 & values-large-v14 are exactly the same, these "double base" themes can be
        inherited from in both values-v14 and values-large-v14.
