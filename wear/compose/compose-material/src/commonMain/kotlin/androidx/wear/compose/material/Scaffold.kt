// TODO(jnichol): Add pagination indication to the scaffold
/**
 * Scaffold implements the basic Wear Material Design visual layout structure.
 *
 * This component provides API to put together several material components to construct your
 * screen, by ensuring proper layout strategy for them and collecting necessary data so these
 * components will work together correctly.
 *
 * The Scaffold provides the main application structure in a Wear Material application. It provides
 * slots for the different parts of the application and sensible defaults were appropriate.
 *
 * The layout of the Wear Scaffold is typically z-layered with decorations such as
 * [PositionIndicator] and [Vignette] applied in the order laid out in the Wear Material Design
 * guidance.
 *
 * Simple example of a Scaffold with a [ScalingLazyColumn] as the main application content and a
 * scroll indicator to show the position of the items in the ScalingLazyColumn as.
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material.samples.SimpleScaffoldWithScrollIndicator
 *
 * @param modifier optional Modifier for the root of the [Scaffold]
 * @param vignette a full screen slot for applying a vignette over the contents of the scaffold. The
 * vignette is used to blur the screen edges when the main content is scrollable content that
 * extends beyond the screen edge.
 * @param positionIndicator slot for optional position indicator used to display information about
 * the position of the Scaffolds contents. Usually a [PositionIndicator]. Common use cases for the
 * position indicator are scroll indication for a list or rsb/bezel indication such as volume.
 * @param timeText time and potential application status message to display at the top middle of the
 * screen. Expected to be a TimeText component.
