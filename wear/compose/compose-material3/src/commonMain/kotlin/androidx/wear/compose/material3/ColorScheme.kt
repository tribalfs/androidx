/**
 * A [ColorScheme] holds all the named color parameters for a [MaterialTheme].
 *
 * Color schemes are designed to be harmonious, ensure accessible text, and distinguish UI
 * elements and surfaces from one another.
 *
 * The Material color system and custom schemes provide default values for color as a starting point
 * for customization.
 *
 * To learn more about color schemes,
 * see [Material Design Color System](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/the-color-system/color-roles).
 *
 * @property primary The primary color is the color displayed most frequently across your appâ€™s
 * screens and components.
 * @property primaryDim is less prominent than [primary] for component backgrounds
 * @property primaryContainer is a standout container color for key components.
 * @property onPrimary Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the primary color.
 * @property onPrimaryContainer The color (and state variants) that should be used for content on
 * top of [primaryContainer].
 * @property secondary The secondary color provides more ways to accent and distinguish your
 * product.
 * @property secondaryDim is less prominent than [secondary] for component backgrounds.
 * @property secondaryContainer A tonal color to be used in containers.
 * @property onSecondary Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the secondary color.
 * @property onSecondaryContainer The color (and state variants) that should be used for content on
 * top of [secondaryContainer].
 * @property tertiary The tertiary color that can be used to balance primary and secondary
 * colors, or bring heightened attention to an element.
 * @property tertiaryDim A less prominent tertiary color that can be used to balance
 * primary and secondary colors, or bring heightened attention to an element.
 * @property tertiaryContainer A tonal color to be used in containers.
 * @property onTertiary Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the tertiary color.
 * @property onTertiaryContainer The color (and state variants) that should be used for content on
 * top of [tertiaryContainer].
 * @property surfaceDim A surface color used for large containment components
 * such as Card and Button with low prominence.
 * @property surface The main surface color that affect surfaces of components with large
 * containment areas, such as Card and Button.
 * @property surfaceBright A surface color used for large containment components
 * such Card and Button with high prominence.
 * @property onSurface Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the surface color.
 * @property onSurfaceVariant The color for secondary text and icons on top of
 * [surface].
 * @property outline The main color for primary outline components.
 * The outline color role adds contrast for accessibility purposes.
 * @property outlineVariant The secondary color for secondary outline components.
 * @property background The background color that appears behind other content.
 * @property onBackground Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the background color.
 * @property error The error color is used to indicate errors.
 * @property onError Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the error color.
