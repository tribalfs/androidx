/**
 * Gateway for proto layout expression library to be able to access sensor data, e.g. health data.

 * <p>Implementations of this class should track a few things:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Surface lifecycle. Implementations should keep track of the surface provider, registered
 *       consumers, and deregister them all when the surface is not longer available.
 *   <li>Device state. Implementations should react to device state (i.e. ambient mode), and
 *       activity state (i.e. surface being in the foreground), and appropriately set the sampling
 *       rate of the sensor (e.g. high rate when surface is in the foreground, otherwise low-rate or
 *       off).
