/**
 * Process Global Configuration for WebView.
 *
 * WebView has some process-global configuration parameters that cannot be changed once WebView has
 * been loaded. This class allows apps to set these parameters.
 * <p>
 * If it is used, the configuration should be set and {@link #apply()} should be called prior to
 * loading WebView into the calling process. Most of the methods in
 * {@link android.webkit} and {@link androidx.webkit} packages load WebView, so the
 * configuration should be applied before calling any of these methods.
 * <p>
 * The following code configures the data directory suffix that WebView
 * uses and then applies the configuration. WebView uses this configuration when it is loaded.
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * ProcessGlobalConfig.createInstance()
 *                    .setDataDirectorySuffix("random_suffix")
 *                    .apply();
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Restrictions are in place to ensure that {@link #createInstance()} can only be called once.
 * The setters and {@link #apply()} can also only be called once.
 * <p>
 * Only a single thread should access this class at a given time.
 * <p>
 * The configuration should be set up as early as possible during application startup, to ensure
 * that it happens before any other thread can call a method that loads WebView.

     * Each directory can be used by only one process in the application. If more

     * the default directory, and other processes must call this API to define

     * share WebView-related data, since the data directories must be distinct.
     * Applications that use this API may have to explicitly pass data between

     * process's cookie jar to the other using {@link android.webkit.CookieManager} if both
     * processes' WebViews are intended to be logged in.

     * that rely on WebView are in the same process, to avoid needing multiple
