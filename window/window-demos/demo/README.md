# WindowManager Jetpack Demos

The `keystore.jks` was generated using sample keys and certificates from Android AOSP. It is used to
sign the demo app with a known key and showcase the usage of ActivityEmbedding APIs across apps
for known certificates. See `build.gradle` for signing and
`window-samples/demo-second-app` for the usage of the known certificate digest.
