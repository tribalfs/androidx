     * split-rule configurations on behalf of the app.
     *
     * If `true`, the system is permitted to override the app's windowing
     * behavior and implement activity embedding split rules, such as displaying
     * activities adjacent to each other. A system override informs the app that
     * the activity embedding APIs are disabled so the app will not provide its
     * own activity embedding rules, which would conflict with the system's
     * rules.
     *
     * If `false`, the system is not permitted to override the windowing
     * behavior of the app. Set the property to `false` if the app provides its
     * own activity embedding split rules, or if you want to prevent the system
     * override for any other reason.
     *
     * The default value is `false`.
     *
     * <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Refusal to permit the system override is not
     * enforceable. OEMs can override the app's activity embedding
     * implementation whether or not this property is specified and set to
     * <code>false</code>. The property is, in effect, a hint to OEMs.</p>
     *
     * OEMs can implement activity embedding on any API level. The best practice
     * for apps is to always explicitly set this property in the app manifest
     * file regardless of targeted API level rather than rely on the default
     * value.
     *
     * **Syntax:**
     * <pre>
     * &lt;application&gt;
     *   &lt;property
     *     android:name="android.window.PROPERTY_ACTIVITY_EMBEDDING_ALLOW_SYSTEM_OVERRIDE"
